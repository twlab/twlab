# Abstract:

Inhibiting epigenetic modulators can transcriptionally reactivate transposable elements (TEs). These TE transcripts often generate unique peptides that can serve as immunogenic antigens for immunotherapy. Here, we ask whether TEs activated by epigenetic therapy could appreciably increase the antigen repertoire in glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer with low mutation and neoantigen burden. We treated patient-derived primary glioblastoma stem cell lines, an astrocyte cell line and primary fibroblast cell lines with epigenetic drugs, and identified treatment-induced, TE-derived transcripts that are preferentially expressed in cancer cells. We verified that these transcripts could produce human leukocyte antigen class I-presented antigens using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry pulldown experiments. Importantly, many TEs were also transcribed, even in proliferating nontumor cell lines, after epigenetic therapy, which suggests that targeted strategies like CRISPR-mediated activation could minimize potential side effects of activating unwanted genomic regions. The results highlight both the need for caution and the promise of future translational efforts in harnessing treatment-induced TE-derived antigens for targeted immunotherapy.
