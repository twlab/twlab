# Abstract:
Genomic variation between individuals is essential for understanding how differences in the genome sequence affect molecular and cellular processes. The Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium aims to uncover the relationships among genomic variation, genome function, and phenotypes by combining experimental techniques, such as single-cell mapping and genomic perturbation assays, with computational approaches such as machine learning-based predictive modeling. The IGVF Data and Administrative Coordinating Centers collect, analyze, and disseminate data and results from across the consortium through an open-source platform called the IGVF Catalog. This resource includes, but is not limited to, data on the effects of coding variants on protein abundance and function, noncoding variants on enhancer activity (measured by MPRA or predicted computationally), and associations between variants and quantitative traits. All data are organized within a graph database comprising over 50 types of data collections with nearly 3 billion nodes and over 7.5 billion edges. The Catalog offers public API endpoints (https://api.catalogkg.igvf.org/) and a user-friendly interface for exploring, querying, and visualizing the data at https://catalog.igvf.org. We expect that this open-access platform will support the broader scientific community to advance our understanding of how genomic variation influences biology and disease.
