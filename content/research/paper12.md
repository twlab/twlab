The WashU Virus Genome Browser is a web-based portal for efficient visualization of viral ‘omics’ data in the context of a variety of annotation tracks and host infection responses. The browser features both a phylogenetic-tree-based view and a genomic-coordinate, track-based view in which users can analyze the sequence features of viral genomes, sequence diversity among viral strains, genomic sites of diagnostic tests, predicted immunogenic epitopes and a continuously updated repository of publicly available genomic datasets.
