____

## **Postdoc (dry and wet lab)**
### Description:
The research focus will be in the general area of computational biology and regulatory genomics, with a particular focus on computational epigenomics. Selected candidate will be fully engaged in the Epigenome Roadmap Project, conduct independent research and development to integrate and decipher large scale epigenomics datasets of multiple cell types, and investigate epigenetic control of transposable elements and its impact on gene regulation.
### Requirements:
- PhD in related fields (physical sciences or biology)
- Strong programming skills, ideally in C or C++ as well as in scripting languages such as perl, python. Experience with statistical techniques and software (R, matlab) and data analysis methods. Should be comfortable in a linux environment, with large data sets, computer clusters, and databases
- Strong quantitative background or computational genomics experiences
- Have good spoken and written communication skills
